# Redim

Redim is a simple web tool designed to help high school students easily concatenate and compress multiple photos of their homework into a single file.

2. **Upload Images**: Click on the upload button to select multiple images from your device.
3. **Generate Output**: Click on the "Generate" button to create the concatenated and compressed image.
4. **Download**: Once the process is complete, download the resulting image file.
